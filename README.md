#### JQuery Exercises

A selection of exercises to practice writing simple functionality with jQuery.

- [ ] Add a click event to the "Click for Triangle!" button so that a triangle shape appears inside the `left-div` (see `showSquare` example function)

- [ ] Add a click event to the center button which changes the class on the circle div to `small-circle`

- [ ] Add a click event to the right-hand button. In this function, you need to first find the selected value from the dropdown and store this in a variable. Based on what the user has selected you can append a div to the `right-container` which matches the shape (use the existing div classes in the css) and add the users name that you have recorded from the `name` input field to a `<h1>` inside the shape div.

- [ ] Add a hover event to the `title` so that the class `title-color` is added to the div
